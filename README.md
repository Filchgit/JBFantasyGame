# JBFantasyGame

 This is a little project I am using while I teach myself C# and wpf The idea is to practice code whilst having fun with interesting subjects. So far I have explored transferring data between Microsoft SQL Server, XML files and also set up TCP/ICP connections so that multiple users can play.
 It is at heart a roleplaying game along the lines of Dungeons and Dragons, and is meant to be an aid for Dungeon masters and players so that they have more time playing and less time reading the rules. 
 It is also very much designed to let DMs change things on the fly to encourage interesting play. ( I also have grand designs in that it will encourage kids to learn SQL database usage!)
